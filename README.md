# A smart contract and dapp template with Hardhat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:


```shell
# for dev
npm run test
npm run coverage
npm run publish:local
npm run publish:prod
npm run publish:test
```


```shell
# for hardhat
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
